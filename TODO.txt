NOTES/TODO

get_songs(year, num_songs) should be getSong(year)
 - rewrite create_round so that calls to addSong get 1 song each

rework list as <li> items

write replace() button handler to replace target li with new song

use fuzzysearch to confirm song in library
 - if not, add song to request list and replace

add finalize button (save list/mark all songs played/add songs to played list)
